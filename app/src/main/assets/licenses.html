        Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
        of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>

          the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
          License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.</p>
    
        <b><a name="section0" id="section0"></a>0. Additional Definitions.</b>

          <p>As used herein, “this License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
              General Public License, and the “GNU GPL” refers to version 3 of the GNU
          General Public License.</p>

          <p>“The Library” refers to a covered work governed by this License,
          other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.</p>

          <p>An “Application” is any work that makes use of an interface provided
          by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
          Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
          of using an interface provided by the Library.</p>

          <p>A “Combined Work” is a work produced by combining or linking an
          Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
              with which the Combined Work was made is also called the “Linked
              Version”.</p>

          <p>The “Minimal Corresponding Source” for a Combined Work means the
          Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
          for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
          based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.</p>

          <p>The “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined Work means the
          object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
          and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
          Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.</p>
    
        <b><a name="section1" id="section1"></a>1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.</b>
    
        <p>You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
          without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.</p>
    
        <b><a name="section2" id="section2"></a>2. Conveying Modified Versions.</b>
    
        <p>If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
          facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
          that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
          facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
          version:</p>
    
        <ul><li>a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
          ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
          function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
          whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or</li>
    
          <li>b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
            this License applicable to that copy.</li>
        </ul><b><a name="section3" id="section3"></a>3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.</b>
    
        <p>The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
          a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
          code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
          material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
          layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
          (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:</p>
    
        <ul><li>a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
          Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
          covered by this License.</li>
    
          <li>b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
            document.</li>
        </ul><b><a name="section4" id="section4"></a>4. Combined Works.</b>
    
        <p>You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
          taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
          portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
          engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
          the following:</p>
    
        <ul><li>a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
          the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
          covered by this License.</li>
    
          <li>b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
            document.</li>
    
          <li>c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
            execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
            these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
            copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.</li>
    
          <li>d) Do one of the following:
    
            <ul><li>0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
              License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
              suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
              recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
              the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
              manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
              Corresponding Source.</li>
    
              <li>1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
                Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
                a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
                system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
                of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
                Version.</li>
    
            </ul></li>
    
          <li>e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
            be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
            GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
            necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
            Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
            Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
            you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
            the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
            Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
            Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
            for conveying Corresponding Source.)</li>
        </ul><b><a name="section5" id="section5"></a>5. Combined Libraries.</b>
    
        <p>You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
          Library side by side in a single library together with other library
          facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
          License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
          choice, if you do both of the following:</p>
    
        <ul><li>a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
          on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
          conveyed under the terms of this License.</li>
    
          <li>b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
            is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
            accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</li>
    
        </ul><b><a name="section6" id="section6"></a>6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.</b>
    
        <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
          of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
          versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
          differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>
    
        <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
          Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
            of the GNU Lesser General Public License “or any later version”
          applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
          conditions either of that published version or of any later version
          published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
          received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
          General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
          General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</p>
    
        <p>If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
          whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
          apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
          permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
          Library.</p>

        </p>

        <h3><em>Statement of Purpose</em></h3>
        <p>The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world
          automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights
          (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each
          and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship and/or
          a database (each, a "Work").</p>
        <p>Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights
          to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of
          creative, cultural and scientific works ("Commons") that the
          public can reliably and without fear of later claims of
          infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works,
          reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form
          whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation
          commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the
          Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further
          production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to
          gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part
          through the use and efforts of others.</p>
        <p>For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and
          without any expectation of additional consideration or
          compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the
          "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of
          Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects
          to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work
          under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and
          Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
          effect of CC0 on those rights.</p>
        <p><strong>1. Copyright and Related Rights.</strong>
          A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by
          copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
          Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but
          are not limited to, the following:
        </p>
        <ol type="i">
          <li>the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform,
            display, communicate, and translate a Work;</li>
          <li> moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or
            performer(s);</li>
          <li>publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's
            image or likeness depicted in a Work;</li>
          <li>rights protecting against unfair competition in regards
            to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a),
            below;</li>
          <li>rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and
            reuse of data in a Work;</li>
          <li>database rights (such as those arising under Directive
            96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11
            March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under
            any national implementation thereof, including any amended
            or successor version of such directive); and</li>
          <li>other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights
            throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and
            any national implementations thereof.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>2. Waiver.</strong> To the greatest extent
          permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law,
          Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
          unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
          Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims
          and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including
          existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in
          the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
          maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty
          (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or
          future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
          purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
          advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer
          makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public
          at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
          successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be
          subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination,
          or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet
          enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by
          Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
        </p>
        <p><strong>3. Public License Fallback.</strong> Should any
          part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or
          ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be
          preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
          Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
          extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each
          affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non
          sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional
          license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights
          in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
          maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty
          (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or
          future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
          purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
          advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The
          License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was

              the Covered Software.  Otherwise, You may also choose to
              use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software

            held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed
            only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.  This
            License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction
            specified in a notice contained within the Original Software
            (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides
